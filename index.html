        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>Problem Statement: The project aims to tackle the lack of affordable housing in Toronto by using government oversight to manage public housing and reduce homelessness. The solution involves developing a neighborhood with Geohaus-designed townhouses, multiplexes, and small apartment buildings.</p>
   
        <p>Objectives: Improving Toronto's transport efficiency, implementing structured systems for building operations, and gathering resources for housing construction.
        </p>
 
        <p>Budget and Cost Analysis: The project has an estimated budget of $300 million.</p>
        
        <p>We plan to develop neighborhoods that incorporate a mix of Geohaus designs, townhouses, multiplexes, and small apartment buildings.</p>

        <p>These housing solutions are designed to be suitable for a diverse population, including families and individuals.</p>
        
        <p>Identifies key stakeholders such as urban households, local authorities, environmental organizations, and interested parties like Great Gulf Homes and Tony Bellisario of Vaughan City Council.</p>

        <h2>Research</h2>

        <p>Introduction to the Problem: Reiterates the impact of the affordable housing issue in Toronto and the projectâ€™s approach to addressing it.</p>

        <p>Our neighborhood project aims to offer an alternative to the traditional housing market, characterized by government-managed public housing units.</p>

        <p>Toronto's systems are frequently counterproductive, contrasting with other regions that better manage similar issues through more supportive infrastructure.</p>

        <p>The 2021 Census of Canada indicates a disproportionate number of single/semi-detached houses and high-rise apartments in Toronto, with a lack of medium-density housing like multiplexes and townhouses.</p>

        <p>Literature Review: Discusses the multifaceted nature of Toronto's housing crisis and the failure of current systems.</p>

        <h2>The Causes</h2>

        <p>Location: The most common adage in real estate is "location, location, location." Properties in desirable locations (e.g., city centers, coastal areas, near economic hubs) are typically more expensive due to high demand.</p>

        <p>Economic Factors: Strong economic growth, high employment rates, and rising incomes in an area can increase the demand for housing, thereby driving up real estate prices.</p>
        
        <p>Limited Supply: In areas where there is limited land for development or strict zoning regulations, the supply of real estate cannot keep up with demand, leading to higher prices.</p>
        
        <p>Investment Demand: Real estate is often seen as a safe and profitable investment. This attracts both domestic and foreign investors, which can drive up prices, especially in sought-after locations.</p>
        
        <p>Speculation: Sometimes, real estate prices are driven up by speculation, where investors buy properties expecting their value to increase, which can create a real estate bubble.</p>
